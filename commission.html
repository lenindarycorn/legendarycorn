     <strong><u>Terms of Service:</u></strong>

     <br> -Commissions for personal use will only be accepted, NOT commissions for commercial use. Examples of personal use include profile pictures/banners for social media or printing.
     <br>-If I feel that I am unable to fulfill your request, I have the right to decline.
     <br>-Depending on complexity of the work, prices are subject to change.
     <br>-No refunds will be permitted for finished commissions.
     <br>-Your commission piece may be used as a sample for my portfolio unless you tell me otherwise.
     <br> 
     <br><strong><u>Payment:</u></strong>
     <br>-Prices are in USD.
     <br>-Payment is accepted via PayPal or Venmo.
     <br>-Half of the payment must be made upfront, and the rest of the payment must be given after the sketch is shown.
     <br><strong>-Again, depending on complexity of the work, prices are subject to change.</strong>
     <br>
     <br><strong><u>Process:</u></strong>
     <br> -You can either fill out this Google form detailing what you want or directly reach out via email or Discord for a faster response.
     <br> -I will follow up with a PayPal invoice or Venmo request for <strong>half of the payment upfront.</strong>
     <br> -After showing the sketch, <strong>you will need to pay the other half before I proceed.</strong> You are allowed to request any changes to the sketch up to three times.
     <br> -You will receive a watermarked and non-watermarked version of the final request. If you are going to post the finished piece on social media, please use the watermarked version.
     <br>-Commissions will take an estimated two weeks to a month depending on other commissions and personal life events.
